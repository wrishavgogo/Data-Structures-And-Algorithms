Problem Statement : 

Given an integer n representing number of vertices. Find out how many undirected graphs (not necessarily connected) can be constructed out of a given n number of vertices.

 

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: 1024
 

Your Task:

Complete the function count() which takes an integer n as input and return the count of total number of graphs possible.



My Experience : 

I was trying to join the vertices and see how many possible ways a new vertex can be added to the set of graphs formed using n - 1 vertices .
Doing that i was not able to figure out any concrete solution . It was becoming a NP problem and was not converging . 

I was thinking lets say n - 1 vertices formed x graphs . 
Now adding one more edge but to which graph and which vertex of the graph . Lets say you want to add this vertex to some sub graph of the disconnected component of the graph .
But the thing is you cannot keep track of all these things 





Learnings : 

The solution completetly looked at the problem from a different perspective . Lets say we now decide the formation of the graph by choosing the number of edges .

how many total number of edges can be there with n vertices ? 

1 -----> can form edges with 2 , 3 , 4 , ... n  = n - 1 edges 
2 -----> can form edges with 3 , 4 , 5 , ...  n = n - 2 edges ( since its undirected hence we dont consider 2 - 1 edge as it was already formed ahead ) 
3 -----> can form edges with 4 , 5 , 6 , .. .n = n - 3 edges 
.
.
.
.
n ----> can form edges with no one = 0 

so totalEdges = ( n - 1 ) + ( n - 2 ) + ( n - 3 ) + . . . .. . .. + 1 = ((n)*(n - 1))/2 = X

Back to how many graphs can be formed using N vertices .

No of graphs with no edge = XC0;
No of graphs with 1 edge = XC1;
No of graphs with 2 edges = XC2;
No of graphs with 3 edges = XC3;
.
.
.
.
No of graphs with X edges = XCX;

total number of graphs = XC0 + XC1 + XC2 + .... + XCX = 2^X; 

this is what becomes . 

Amazing thought process
