Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-greatest-common-divisors-in-linked-list/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-all 

There is a given linkedlist , and 
you have to insert a node in b/w two nodes which will have the value of gcd(node.val , node.next.val) 

My experience : 

Dude i forgot how to calculate gcd man . Havent done maths problem in so long oh no 

For now am shamefully finding gcd by using dividing  by 1 to n and finding highest factor . I know i know , its cringe , but for now please excuse me
