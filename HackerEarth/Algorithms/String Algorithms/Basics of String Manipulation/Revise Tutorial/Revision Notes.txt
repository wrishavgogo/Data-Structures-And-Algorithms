For a given String java provides inbuilt method to get a substring for it 


String s = "abcdefghijklmnop"
String subStr = s.substring(n , m ) --> this returns the substring from index n to index m - 1 , 
                                    ---> first index is inclusive , last index is exclusive 

char[] arr = s.toCharArray(); 
// converts String to character array 


Arrays.sort(arr) --> primitive data types cannot be sorted using a comparator , as comparator work with Reference types ,
  so we have to work with boxing them 
  Character[] arr = s.toCharArray();

// but this will not work , you have to manually box each and every index in the array
