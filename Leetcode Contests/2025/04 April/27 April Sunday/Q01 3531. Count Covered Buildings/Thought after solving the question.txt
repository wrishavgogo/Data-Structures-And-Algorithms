Now that i think about it ,

for any rowId -> { col1 , col2 , col3 , col4 , col5 ... col}
for any colId -> { row1 , row2 , row3 , row4 , row5 ,... row}

i dont need to maintain , the whole col1 , col2 .... whole array in sorted fashion , 
i can just hold the minCol and maxCol , that way i will save insertion time and space as well , o(1) operation it will be  


also dont forget the treeSet.first() and treeSet.last() -> these fucntions to get first and last element of the treeSet
