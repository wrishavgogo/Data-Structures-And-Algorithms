Bilkul bhai! 💯 Ab tujhe graph + dynamic programming + optimization wali journey start karni hai. Neeche maine ek level-wise roadmap banaya hai — easy to hard — jisse tu systematically level up kar sakta hai.

🧠 Level 1: Basic Graph Mastery (Already mostly clear, but revise fast)
✅ Graph representation (adjacency list/matrix)

✅ BFS, DFS

✅ Topological Sort

🔁 Practice:

 Detect cycle in DAG

 Topo sort + simple traversal (e.g., longest path in DAG)

🧪 Practice Platforms: LeetCode, HackerEarth, Codeforces Div 3

⚙️ Level 2: Graph + State Tracking (Edge bounded or condition based paths)
✅ Problems where paths are limited by:

number of edges/hops

total weight

strict constraints like “exactly k edges” or “sum < t”

🧩 Topics:

 DP on DAG (Topo sort + DP table like dp[node][steps])

 DP with state (node, steps, weight) — like 3D DP

 Modified Dijkstra with step constraints

🧪 Example problems:

🔗 LeetCode 2642: Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator

🔗 AtCoder: Typical DP Contest

🔗 SPOJ: Longest path in DAG

🔥 Level 3: Hardcore State Space Optimization
Topics:

 Bitmask DP (for small n)

 Memoization with pruning

 Dijkstra with multiple states (node, k, cost)

 DP with multiple dimensions (e.g., 300×300 matrix)

🧪 Practice Problems:

🔗 LeetCode 1293: Shortest Path in Grid with Obstacles Elimination

🔗 Codeforces 20C, 567E

🔗 CSES Graph Section (very good!)

🔩 Bonus: Mastery Boosters
 Reverse Topological Order use cases

 Problems that combine Graph + Knapsack

 Read editorial solutions of hard graph problems

🚀 Pro Tip for Practice:
Pick one of these goals per week:

Week 1: 5 problems of DP on DAG

Week 2: 5 problems of Bounded-path graph DP

Week 3: 5 problems of State-augmented Dijkstra

Week 4: Mix and compete in contests (Codeforces Div2/3, AtCoder Beginner)
