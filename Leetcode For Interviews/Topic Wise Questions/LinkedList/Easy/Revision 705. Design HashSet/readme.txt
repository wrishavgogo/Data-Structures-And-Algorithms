This problem is of easy category but has a lot of information in terms of coding context and i will utilize this problem fully . 

We know that in hashSet when a collision occurs we want to convert it into a linkedList and make a list of chain of the keys , 
but we want to convert it into a BST when the list grows too big , 
In bst in case of insertion or deletion its very well possible that the tree can become skewed . I want to convert this tree into AVL tree.

This will help me improve my knowledge and make my easily code AVL tree . 


In the sexy Datastructures folder read about avl TREE explanation that i have made , your brain will reconnect the dots amazingly. I made good notes the way i understood it and 
not in someway someone else explained it to me
